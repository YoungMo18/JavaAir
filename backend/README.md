2) The additional piece of info that I got from a url is the site_name. I noticed that it was one of the optional metadata for Open Graph,
so I decided to use it. If the site_name exist, it would be displayed in preview as "Site name: __". Here's a sample url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig1FM97uwSo
3) I made one visual change and it was to create a border-radius of 5px. I think this is a improvement because it modernizes the look of the
preview. I was inspired by Apple's icons with its curved edge design (rather than a box with sharp edges).
